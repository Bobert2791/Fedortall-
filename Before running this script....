1. which kernel i'm downloading? 
R: this is my favorite kernel which name is liquorix kernel, is a gaming kernel that improves latency and reduce frame time deviation in games

2. why downloading and not installing?
R: i just give the option to download it cause i think it gon to be too much edit your grub config file to use the liquorix kernel making that your choice to use this kernel

3. why making this script 
R: this script is design for a clean install of Fedora to just install what you need for gaming if you're too lazy to do it by yourself
